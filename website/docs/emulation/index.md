# Emulation

## Why emulation?

Emulation serves two purposes:

1. Software emulation (e.g. using MAME) specifically allows us to figure out the expectations of the original hardware, and to test our understanding of the hardware.  For instance working in MAME is what pointed out that while the dn300 often came with PRIAM disks, the protocol used is not PRIAM-specific, but is rather a generic ANSI protocol.

2. Hardware emulation (building new hardware that behaves like the original) is necessary because a lot of the original hardware is no longer available.  Keyboards get scrapped, disks die, and so on.  We need to be able to replace these components with something that behaves like the original.
